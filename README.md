# MultikeyVideoStopwatch

A simple video stopwatch that takes user-defined keyboard inputs during video playback to populate a frame-by-frame binary timeseries of keyboard input events in addition to calculating the total duration (s) of each keyboard input. Useful for applications that require manual measurement of the duration and onset/offset times of events in video recordings.
